      <Typography variant="h5">The story so far</Typography>
      <p>Intentional Ventures began April 2024 with a founding team of about a dozen.</p>

      <p>After three quarters with its founding team, at the end of 2024 IV had experimentally generated revenue, established 
        key design principles, evolved a two-space structure, and added its first new (non-founding) participants. </p>
      
      <p>Inside Limicon 2025 (throughout March), some IV "exploration space" activites 
        were shared in a four-part "Build-a-thon" series:
        <ul>
          <li>Generative ideation</li>
          <li>Collaborative chemistry</li>
          <li>Venture assembly</li>
          <li>Storytelling practice</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p>The "execution space" focuses on <a href="https://otherinter.net/research/squad-wealth/">Squad</a>-shaped 
         support with an "extended family" ecosystem of support 
         via awareness/perspectival reflection, technical expertise, and catalyzing capital.</p>

      <p>The "three skills" held as a baseline of Intentional Ventures participants are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Rationality - systematic thought and conventional professional skills</li>
        <li>Relationality - robust emotional capacity and relational agility</li>
        <li>Perspectivity - fluid perspective-taking, metasystematicity, complex systems lens</li>
      </ul>

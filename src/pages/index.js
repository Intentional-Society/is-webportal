      <Typography variant="h4">IS Community</Typography>
      <p>Community members gather on Sundays for weekly calls, and/or support one another in relational "pods", 
        while forming and deepening relationships with other community members. We play together in a relational 
        sandbox of practices, explorations, creativity, and leadership development as we cultivate the kind of 
        collective culture that supports us in our "being who we want to be" into the whole of our lives.</p>

        more and apply here.</a> Membership is free (always has been), and the 
        light application-and-agreements membrane that defines membership exists to let us 
        create openness and safety in our private cozyweb and manage our private data sharing. 
        You're invited to attend an <Link to="/get-involved#office-hours">Office Hours</Link> call 
        for orientation purposes, yet if you've been to at least one Practice Dojo session previously, y
        ou probably have enough of the vibe to dive in if you prefer.</p>

      <Typography variant="h4">Intentional Ventures</Typography>

      <p>After two quarters in incubation with the founding team of 10, IV has established 
        key structures and principles, and intends to invite new members from the waitlist in Q4. 
        To be added to the waitlist, come chat about it at <Link to="/get-involved#office-hours">Office Hours</Link>.</p>

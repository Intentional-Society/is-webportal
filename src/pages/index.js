      <p>Our 15th seasonal/quarterly cycle runs July through September 2024.</p>

      <Typography variant="h4">Practice Dojo â€” Connection Lab</Typography>
      <p>Meets on Saturdays. Dates: <b>July 27th, August 17th, September 7th</b></p>
      <p>We'll be using a "Connection Lab" theme to meet each other, 
        human to human, and fine-tune our toolkit of practices for making connections and 
        bridging differences. The goal is that you'll be able to add these to *your* toolkit 
        of intentional relating, becoming more easily able to connect with anyone you choose to.</p>

        create openness and safety in our private cozyweb and manage our private data sharing. If you 
        haven't been to at least one Practice Dojo session previously, please plan to attend 
        an <Link to="/get-involved#office-hours">Office Hours</Link> call for orientation purposes.</p>

      <p>Since Jan 2021 we've been exploring and relating together weekly, 
        with <Link to="/history">more than 150 sessions</Link> under our belts.</p>
      <p>
        You can read more about <Link to="/who-we-are">who we 
        are</Link> and <Link to="/what-we-do">what we do</Link>, and find a few 
        different inroads to <Link to="/get-involved">get involved</Link> if and when you feel so called.

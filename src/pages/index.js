      <p>Intentional Society is made of people, practices, and culture held

      It's a place to grow and develop yourself in a warm, supportive community.<br/>
      It's a living probe into stabilizing and spreading self-transforming collective culture.<br/>
      It's a future society that better supports the thriving of humans and humanity.</p>

      <Typography variant="h4">Practice Program Q1 2024</Typography>

      <p>Liberation. Joy. Meaning. Adaptability. Equanimity.  
        Not from logic, nor from magic, but freely available through 
        interactive, relational, practical experience...</p>

      <p>For the first time, Intentional Society has assembled its best practices
        into a publicly-accessible 9-week program designed to support post-conventional personal development.
        In plain words, we're building a bridge to "being who we want to be" 
        beyond what society typically offers us. 
        With nine practices in nine weeks, each week utilizes a different relational practice, 
        from the well-known (IFS, Circling, Case Clinic) to the home-grown, assembled over 
        hundreds of hours of participatory research across the last three years.
      </p>

      <p>No membership commitment required â€” if you resonate with this invitation, you may attend any 
        and all weeks. Sessions will occur the first three weeks of each of 
        January (7/14/21st), February (4/11/18th), and March (3/10/17th) 2024, 
        all starting 1pm Sunday Pacific Time and 90 minutes in length.

      <p>In the Connection Lab sessions we will practice making contact with each other, human to human, and 
        refine our toolkit of practices for making connections and bridging differences. Success means that 
        you'll be able to add these to *your* relational toolkit, becoming more easily able to connect 
        with anyone you choose to.</p>

        light application-and-agreements membrane that defines membership exists to let us 
        create openness and safety in our private cozyweb and manage our private data sharing. If you

        an <Link to="/get-involved#office-hours">Office Hours</Link> call for orientation purposes.</p>

        You can read more about <Link to="/who-we-are">who we 
        are</Link> and <Link to="/what-we-do">what we do</Link>, and find a few

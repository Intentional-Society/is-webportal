      <p>Year five of Intentional Society begins with our  17<sup>th</sup> seasonal/quarterly cycle,
        running January through March of 2025. Intentional 
        Society currently has three main spaces/places with varying levels of openness and commitment. 
        Whoever and wherever you are, you are invited to draw closer in connection with the people 
        and purposes of IS.</p>

      <Typography variant="h4">IS Community Hub (members collective)</Typography>

      <p>Community members gather on Sundays for weekly calls, and/or support one another in relational "pods", 
        while forming and deepening relationships with other community members. We play together in a relational 
        sandbox of practices, explorations, creativity, and leadership development as we cultivate the kind of 
        collective culture that supports us in our "being who we want to be" into the whole of our lives.</p>

        more and apply here.</a> Membership is free (always has been), and the 
        light application-and-agreements membrane that defines membership exists to let us 
        create openness and safety in our private cozyweb and manage our private data sharing. 
        You're invited to attend an <Link to="/get-involved#office-hours">Office Hours</Link> call 
        for orientation purposes, yet if you've been to at least one Practice Dojo session previously,
        you probably have enough of the vibe to dive in if you prefer.</p>

      <Typography variant="h4">Intentional Ventures (private experiment)</Typography>

      <p>We unlock successful economics for meaningful livelihoods through relational support.</p>

      <p>After three quarters with its founding team, IV has made its first revenue, established 
        key structures and principles, and added its first new participants. 
        To be added to the waitlist, come chat about it at <Link to="/get-involved#office-hours">Office Hours</Link> or 
        talk to any participant.</p>

      <p>For four years now we've been exploring and relating together weekly, 
        with <Link to="/history">more than 200 sessions</Link> under our belts.</p>

        You can read more about <Link to="/who-we-are">who we 
        are</Link> and <Link to="/what-we-do">what we do</Link>, and find a few 
        different inroads to <Link to="/get-involved">get involved</Link> if and when you feel so called.

    <h3>Informational Calls</h3>
    <p>These are introductory sessions for newcomers who are curious about Intentional Society. All 
      are welcome, and will hear a 20-minute explanatory effort on the design and current status of 
      the community. Using a video camera and microphone is encouraged.
    </p>
    <p><a href="https://us02web.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZUlduuvqTwiGtNnGEb4itU3ydQoBxYpch53">Register 
      here</a> for the next call on Sunday Feb 14th, 11:00-11:55am Pacific (2pm Eastern).
    </p>

    <h3>General Sessions</h3>
    <p>These meetings are for members (informally self-identified, at present) of Intentional Society. 
      Our primary focus is exploring a variety of relational practices towards connection, trust, and authenticity. 
      We're also spending some time each week on self-organization, decision-making, and governance topics.
      Attending an informational call is a prerequesite - and yes, doing both in one day is okay.
      General sessions currently happen on Sundays, 1:00-2:45pm Pacific (4pm Eastern). This form might 
      split or significantly change at any time.

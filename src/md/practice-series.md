# IS Developmental Practice Series

Skillful relating to inner and outer challenges. Liberation from stuckness and not-okay-ness. Spacious ease and equanimity. These are learnable skills, freely available through interactive, relational, intentional practice in a supportive environment.

The key mechanism of psychological adult development is (roughly) _perspective-expansion_ — our ability to move from "being caught up in it" to "seeing, welcoming, and working with it". Leveraging years of action-research experience from Intentional Society, the Developmental Practice Series assembles a powerful sequence of practices supporting post-conventional personal development.

In plain words, we're building a bridge to "being who we want to be" beyond what society typically offers us. This series is being run as a nine-week course on Thursdays starting July 10<sup>th</sup>, 9:00am to 10:30am Pacific (Noon Eastern, 4pm UTC, 6pm CEST).

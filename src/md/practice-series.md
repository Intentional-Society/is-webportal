# The IS Developmental Practice Series

## Introduction from January 2024

(Note: This is historical text and will be revised the next time this series runs.)

Liberation. Joy. Meaning. Adaptability. Equanimity.  
Not from logic, nor from magic, but freely available through interactive, relational, practical experience...

For the first time, Intentional Society has assembled its best practices into a publicly-accessible 9-week program designed to support post-conventional personal development. In plain words, we're building a bridge to "being who we want to be" beyond what society typically offers us. With nine practices in nine weeks, each week utilizes a different relational practice, from the well-known (IFS, Circling, Case Clinic) to the home-grown, assembled over hundreds of hours of participatory research across the last three years.

No membership commitment required — if you resonate with this invitation, you may attend any and all weeks. Sessions occur the first three weeks of each of January (7/14/21st), February (4/11/18th), and March (3/10/17th) 2024, all starting 1pm Sunday Pacific Time and 90 minutes in length.

Nine weeks, nine practices:

#### Empathy Circle – reflective listening

#### Parts Work (IFS) – listening to self

#### Interpersonal Gap – perspectival hygiene

#### T-Group – naming feelings

#### Circling – welcoming everything

#### Inquiry Spiraling – perspective weaving

#### Nine Whys – (re)connecting to desire

#### Pure coaching + Clean language – coaching basics

#### Case Clinic – coaching in action

These are grouped into three themes: Awareness, Acceptance, Integrity

Each theme corresponds to a three-week cluster of practices.

## The IS (developmental/core) Practice Series

### Introduction January 2024
Liberation. Joy. Meaning. Adaptability. Equanimity.  
Not from logic, nor from magic, but freely available through interactive, relational, practical experience...

For the first time, Intentional Society has assembled its best practices into a publicly-accessible 9-week program designed to support post-conventional personal development. In plain words, we're building a bridge to "being who we want to be" beyond what society typically offers us. With nine practices in nine weeks, each week utilizes a different relational practice, from the well-known (IFS, Circling, Case Clinic) to the home-grown, assembled over hundreds of hours of participatory research across the last three years.

No membership commitment required — if you resonate with this invitation, you may attend any and all weeks. Sessions will occur the first three weeks of each of January (7/14/21st), February (4/11/18th), and March (3/10/17th) 2024, all starting 1pm Sunday Pacific Time and 90 minutes in length.

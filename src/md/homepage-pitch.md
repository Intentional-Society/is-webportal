The societal crisis is pretty evident at this point, right? The problems are surrounding us, between us, and even inside us. Building a solution starts with _intention_ and _awareness_.

Hi there. :wave: I suppose even before that, comes a manifesto. I'll try to keep this short. Concretely, I think this challenge has three scopes:

1.  I've discovered personally that "growing up" connects to spaces much bigger than typical modern adulthood. My conventional modern self-identity failed and forced me to find another path. That path is both new and old; it is extremely rational and also what mystics have pointed to for centuries. Self-awareness, exploration, integration - practices of personal growth and development.

2. Ironically, we can't be our whole selves without the support of others! Meanwhile our village tribes are gone or gutted, our friendships are scattered, and our traditional communities are waning. Our relationships are strained and stressed in this social media age of algorithmically intermediated digital disconnection and physical isolation. But time spent in rich connection and friendship is deeply nourishing and generative!

3. We can see the existential risks facing our society and our species. Our (and I speak in the USA context here) polarized political landscape and our response to an epidemic have both demonstrated the woeful inadequacy of our collective capacity for sensemaking and coordination. We'll have to do much better to survive climate change, inequity and autocracy, superintelligent AI, and the relentless distribution of greater technological power in nano-, bio-, and other domains.

So, what of a solution?

_Intention_ is the will to cause something to change. _Awareness_ is the means to attend to what's really there. Together they bring us the capacity to become our biggest selves and the capability to move through increasing complexity.

This whole complex system of I, you, we, and society must adapt by developing its capacity and capability - at least, if we are to experience a path of thriving humanity, more than one of suffering.

I am one person. I am a part of that system. So are you. None of us can beat the system. There is no conventional solution. But there is a bigger one out there - waiting for us to grow a new system that can succeed the old one.

Yikes. Most people flinch away at this point. Honestly, what can they do? Shrug their shoulders, avert their eyes, and turn back to doing whatever makes sense in their conventional social frame. But you and I, we might dare to face it.

Awareness breaks through the frames limiting our perspective. Intention unlocks fluid non-coercive motion through the paradox of accepting and holding the world as it is alongside our desire to steer its future path. A bigger, better mode of being is possible when we embody these shifts in our own personal growth and development.

We must do this work inside ourselves as individuals. But we can't do it on our own, either - we must borrow each others' eyes to see ourselves from a big enough perspective. A bigger stance results in increased capacity, greater awareness, higher agency, bigger perspective, meaningful contribution, and deeper peace. And only our collective efforts can establish the new cultural code required to support our society in expanding its ability to meet the existential challenges.

I'm looking for allies right now: pioneers of co-creation as we seek to grow a coherent... something. I can't even define it yet - we can find the way only by walking the path together. I hope, as I point in this direction, to find the others that can also see the destination.
